## Announcement

LeoMoeAPI v1 will end service support on September 1, 2024. Versions **v1.1.7** and below that rely on its service will become unusable. Please download from the [Ntrace-V1 repository](https://github.com/nxtrace/Ntrace-V1/releases) NextTrace.

Because NextTrace V1 and V2 are branches with differing development philosophies, each is currently managed by an internal Owner focusing on different aspects. These branches cater to developers with varying needs. Now, the [V1](https://github.com/nxtrace/Ntrace-V1/) and [V2](https://github.com/sjlleo/MoeTrace) branch has established its own separate repository. For a considerably long period in the future, we plan to maintain the development and upkeep of both branches simultaneously.

## How To Use

Document Language: English | [简体中文](README_zh_CN.md)

Currently, **V2 version** is a completely redesigned project and is recruiting beta testers for this revamped version. If you are interested, please check out [sjlleo/MoeTrace](https://github.com/sjlleo/MoeTrace).

For the **enhanced version of V1**, please visit [nxtrace/Ntrace-V1](https://github.com/nxtrace/Ntrace-V1).

    Please note, the repositories for all of the above installation methods are maintained by open source enthusiasts. Availability and timely updates are not guaranteed. If you encounter problems, please contact the repository maintainer to solve them, or use the binary packages provided by the official build of this project.

### Manual Install
* Download the precompiled executable

    For users not covered by the above methods, please go directly to [Release](https://github.com/nxtrace/Ntrace-V1/releases/latest) to download the compiled binary executable.

    * `Release` provides compiled binary executables for many systems and different architectures. If none are available, you can compile it yourself.
    * Some essential dependencies of this project are not fully implemented on `Windows` by `Golang`, so currently, `NextTrace` is in an experimental support phase on the `Windows` platform.

* Install from source

    After installing Go >= 1.20 yourself, you can use the following command to install

    ```shell
    go install github.com/nxtrace/Ntrace-V1@latest
    ```
    After installation, the executable is in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory. If you have not set `GOPATH`, it is in the `$HOME/go/bin` directory.


### Get Started

`NextTrace` uses the `ICMP` protocol to perform TraceRoute requests by default, which supports both `IPv4` and `IPv6`

```bash
# IPv4 ICMP Trace
nexttrace 1.0.0.1
# URL
nexttrace http://example.com:8080/index.html?q=1

# Form printing
nexttrace --table 1.0.0.1

# An Output Easy to Parse
nexttrace --raw 1.0.0.1
nexttrace --json 1.0.0.1

# IPv4/IPv6 Resolve Only
nexttrace --ipv4 g.co
nexttrace --ipv6 g.co

# IPv6 ICMP Trace
nexttrace 2606:4700:4700::1111

# Disable Path Visualization With the -M parameter
nexttrace koreacentral.blob.core.windows.net
# MapTrace URL: https://api.leo.moe/tracemap/html/c14e439e-3250-5310-8965-42a1e3545266.html

# Disable MPLS display using the --disable-mpls / -e parameter or the NEXTTRACE_DISABLEMPLS environment variable
nexttrace --disable-mpls example.com
export NEXTTRACE_DISABLEMPLS=1
```

PS: The routing visualization drawing module was written by [@tsosunchia](https://github.com/tsosunchia), and the specific code can be viewed at [tsosunchia/traceMap](https://github.com/tsosunchia/traceMap).

Note that in LeoMoeAPI 2.0, due to the addition of geographical location data, **we have deprecated the online query part of the OpenStreetMap API in the traceMap plugin and are using location information from our own database**.

The routing visualization function requires the geographical coordinates of each Hop, but third-party APIs generally do not provide this information, so this function is currently only supported when used with LeoMoeAPI.

`NextTrace` now supports quick testing, and friends who have a one-time backhaul routing test requirement can use it

```bash
# IPv4 ICMP Fast Test (Beijing + Shanghai + Guangzhou + Hangzhou) in China Telecom / Unicom / Mobile / Education Network
nexttrace --fast-trace

# You can also use TCP SYN for testing
nexttrace --fast-trace --tcp
```

`NextTrace` already supports route tracing for specified Network Devices

```bash
# Use eth0 network interface
nexttrace --dev eth0 2606:4700:4700::1111

# Use eth0 network interface's IP
# When using the network interface's IP for route tracing, note that the IP type to be traced should be the same as network interface's IP type (e.g. both IPv4)
nexttrace --source 204.98.134.56 9.9.9.9
```

`NextTrace` can also use `TCP` and `UDP` protocols to perform `Traceroute` requests, but `UDP` protocols only supports `IPv4` now

```bash
# TCP SYN Trace
nexttrace --tcp www.bing.com

# You can specify the port by yourself [here is 443], the default port is 80
nexttrace --tcp --port 443 2001:4860:4860::8888

# UDP Trace
nexttrace --udp 1.0.0.1

nexttrace --udp --port 53 1.0.0.1
```

`NextTrace` also supports some advanced functions, such as ttl control, concurrent probe packet count control, mode switching, etc.

```bash
# Send 2 probe packets per hop
nexttrace --queries 2 www.hkix.net

# No concurrent probe packets, only one probe packet is sent at a time
nexttrace --parallel-requests 1 www.hkix.net

# Start Trace with TTL of 5, end at TTL of 10
nexttrace --first 5 --max-hops 10 www.decix.net

# Turn off the IP reverse parsing function
nexttrace --no-rdns www.bbix.net

# Set the payload size to 1024 bytes
nexttrace --psize 1024 example.com

# Feature: print Route-Path diagram
# Route-Path diagram example:
# AS6453 Tata Communication「Singapore『Singapore』」
#  ╭╯
#  ╰AS9299 Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co.「Philippines『Metro Manila』」
#  ╭╯
#  ╰AS36776 Five9 Inc.「Philippines『Metro Manila』」
#  ╭╯
#  ╰AS37963 Aliyun「ALIDNS.COM『ALIDNS.COM』」
nexttrace --route-path www.time.com.my
```

`NextTrace` supports users to select their own IP API (currently supports: `LeoMoeAPI`, `IP.SB`, `IPInfo`, `IPInsight`, `IPAPI.com`, `Ip2region`, `IPInfoLocal`, `CHUNZHEN`)

```bash
# You can specify the IP database by yourself [IP-API.com here], if not specified, LeoMoeAPI will be used
nexttrace --data-provider ip-api.com
## Note There are frequency limits for free queries of the ipinfo and IPInsight APIs. You can purchase services from these providers to remove the limits
##      If necessary, you can clone this project, add the token provided by ipinfo or IPInsight and compile it yourself
## Note For the offline database IPInfoLocal, please download it manually and rename it to ipinfoLocal.mmdb. (You can download it from here: https://ipinfo.io/signup?ref=free-database-downloads)
##      For the offline database Ip2region, you can download it manually and rename it to ip2region.db, or let NextTrace download it automatically
## Fill the token to: ipgeo/tokens.go
## Please be aware: Due to the serious abuse of IP.SB, you will often be not able to query IP data from this source
## IP-API.com has a stricter restiction on API calls, if you can't query IP data from this source, please try again in a few minutes

# The Pure-FTPd IP database defaults to using http://127.0.0.1:2060 as the query interface. To customize it, please use environment variables
export NEXTTRACE_CHUNZHENURL=http://127.0.0.1:2060
## You can use https://github.com/freshcn/qqwry to build your own Pure-FTPd IP database service

# You can also specify the default IP database by setting an environment variable
export NEXTTRACE_DATAPROVIDER=ipinfo
```

`NextTrace` supports mixed parameters and shortened parameters

```bash
Example:
nexttrace --data-provider IPAPI.com --max-hops 20 --tcp --port 443 --queries 5 --no-rdns 1.1.1.1
nexttrace -tcp --queries 2 --parallel-requests 1 --table --route-path 2001:4860:4860::8888

Equivalent to:
nexttrace -d IPAPI.com -m 20 -T -p 443 -q 5 -n 1.1.1.1
nexttrace -T -q 2 --parallel-requests 1 -t -R 2001:4860:4860::8888
```

### IP Database

#### We use [bgp.tools](https://bgp.tools) as a data provider for routing tables.

NextTrace BackEnd is now open-source.

https://github.com/sjlleo/nexttrace-backend

NextTrace `LeoMoeAPI` now utilizes the Proof of Work (POW) mechanism to prevent abuse, where NextTrace introduces the powclient library as a client-side component. Both the POW CLIENT and SERVER are open source, and everyone is welcome to use them. (Please direct any POW module-related questions to the corresponding repositories)

- [GitHub - tsosunchia/powclient: Proof of Work CLIENT for NextTrace](https://github.com/tsosunchia/powclient)
- [GitHub - tsosunchia/powserver: Proof of Work SERVER for NextTrace](https://github.com/tsosunchia/powserver)

## OpenTrace

`OpenTrace` is the cross-platform `GUI` version of `NextTrace` developed by @Archeb, bringing a familiar but more powerful user experience.

This software is still in the early stages of development and may have many flaws and errors. We value your feedback.

[https://github.com/Archeb/opentrace](https://github.com/Archeb/opentrace)

## NEXTTRACE WEB API

`NextTraceWebApi` is a web-based server implementation of `NextTrace` in the `MTR` style, offering various deployment options including `Docker`.

[https://github.com/nxtrace/nexttracewebapi](https://github.com/nxtrace/nexttracewebapi)

## LeoMoeAPI Credit

NextTrace focuses on Golang Traceroute implementations, and its LeoMoeAPI geolocation information is not supported by raw data, so a commercial version is not possible.

The LeoMoeAPI data is subject to copyright restrictions from multiple data sources, and is only used for the purpose of displaying the geolocation of route tracing.

1. We would like to credit samleong123 for providing nodes in Malaysia, TOHUNET Looking Glass for global nodes, and Ping.sx from Misaka, where more than 80% of reliable calibration data comes from ping/mtr reports.

2. At the same time, we would like to credit isyekong for their contribution to rDNS-based calibration ideas and data. LeoMoeAPI is accelerating the development of rDNS resolution function, and has already achieved automated geolocation resolution for some backbone networks, but there are some misjudgments. We hope that NextTrace will become a One-Man ISP-friendly traceroute tool in the future, and we are working on improving the calibration of these ASN micro-backbones as much as possible.

3. In terms of development, I would like to credit missuo and zhshch for their help with Go cross-compilation, design concepts and TCP/UDP Traceroute refactoring, and tsosunchia for their support on TraceMap.

4. I would also like to credit FFEE_CO, TheresaQWQ, stydxm and others for their help. leoMoeAPI has received a lot of support since its first release, so I would like to credit them all!

We hope you can give us as much feedback as possible on IP geolocation errors (see issue) so that it can be calibrated in the first place and others can benefit from it.
